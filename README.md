# Geodesics, Curvature, and Divergence on Finite 2-Manifolds

**Author:** Shreshth Rajan

## Abstract

For finite triangulated surfaces, we study how graph sphere growth captures curvature through discrete Gauss-Bonnet theory. We prove the discrete geodesic divergence functional D_G(v,1) = -6K_G(v) exactly detects curvature at first order, with Σ D_G = -6χ encoding global topology. Each finite triangulation can be viewed as a "geometric world" where curvature governs trajectory behavior, mirroring the role of curvature in general relativity.

## Key Results

- **Main Identity:** D_G(v,1) = -6K_G(v) (graph sphere divergence equals curvature)
- **Global Formula:** Σ_v D_G(v,1) = -6χ(G) (average divergence encodes Euler characteristic)
- **Three settings explored:** Smooth surfaces, polyhedral cones, graph 2-manifolds
